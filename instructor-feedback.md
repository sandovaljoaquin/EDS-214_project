## Collaboration 

I think my participation in the peer feedback went well. I looked over Peter's project which was pretty polished at the time. He met almost all specs. The only one that was not met was the visual flowchart in the read.me. I opened up this issue in github and also added a roxygen skeleton to his two functions in their r script.

# Instructor feedback

## Automate

[M] **Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**

[M] The analysis runs without errors

[M] **The analysis produces the expected output**

[NY] **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

- You do this in separate scripts, but then you repeat it in paper.qmd

## Organize

[Y] Raw data is contained in its own folder

[NY] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

- See **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

[M] **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file**

## Document

[NY] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

- No README?

[NY] **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**

- No README?

[M] **The code is appropriately commented**

[M] **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**
