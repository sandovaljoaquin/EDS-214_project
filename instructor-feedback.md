## Collaboration 

I think my participation in the peer feedback went well. I looked over Peter's project which was pretty polished at the time. He met almost all specs. The only one that was not met was the visual flowchart in the read.me. I opened up this issue in github and also added a roxygen skeleton to his two functions in their r script.
